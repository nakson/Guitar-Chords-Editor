Sister Golden Hair -America 
verse1: 
Well I tried to make it sunday but I got so damned depressed 
That I [A] set my[E] sights on [E] monday and I [G#min] got myself [G#min] undressed 
I ain't ready for the alter, but I [C#min] do [G#min] believe there's [A] times 
When a [F#min] woman sure can [A] be a friend of [E] mine [Esus2] [E]
